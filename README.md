# Note Taker
This application is designed to provide users a place to store notes and to-do tasks as a way to be more organized and keep track of the things they need to do throughout the day or week.  
This project is powered by Bootstrap for the front-end and Express and JavaScript for the back-end. It utilizes a database with a json file to save and retrieve data which is then displayed to the user of the application. The challenge for this application was to connect the front-end to the back-end through the use of GET, POST and DELETE requests with Express.js - this allows the user to add, save and delete posts when using the application. 
The backend application that assisted me in testing the GET, POST and DELETE requests was Insomnia.
This was a challenging but fun project to do as I learned more about the Express framework, APIs, and how to fully connect an application from the front-end to the back-end.
